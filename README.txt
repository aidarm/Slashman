This application allows users to take a photo (through a mobile phone) of the product barcode or search the code manually, typing it digit by digit.
Users can get any kind of information about any item, if not, they can easily add it to the product database through a minimalistic CMS.

If you are using PC, you can use two test images from /img folder, which will show you the products. It is not an advertisement! :) Or create your own!

This application is just a small prototype of the actual idea, which we would like to seriously expand later, using other advanced web technologies.
Nevertheless, many hours were spent on correction of very small details and debugging of very little problems, since jQuery technology itself, form our point of view and experience, is far from perfection.

The very code of ours can be found in the whole /php folder, /js/main.js, partly /js/scanner.js, /css/main.css and of course /index.html.

Big thanks to Eddie Larson for an amazing barcode scanner algorithm!
